v4.22 [6/29/2021]

WOW PATCH 9.1 (Do Not Use On 9.0.5)

Fixes:
- Fixed Help Icon not rendering
- Changed Error check on health element
- Reputation bar fixes for full display didnt seem to work as intended
- Chat: Fix broken invite link
- Protect against invalid db entries for role icons if another addon that added an icon was disabled/removed from wow

Added:
- Added Discord url for support
- Added option to disable S&L Media section to help be more compatible with other addons that do similar things like ToxiUI
- Enhanced shadows on objective frame (scenario/m+ frame)

Changes:
- S&L AFK Mode: Rewrote majority of S&L AFK to be more customizable, expanded on the options so much so, it's easier to just look at the options instead of trying to list them.
